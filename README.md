This Repository has all the files pertaining to the creation, and testing of a bit serial adder subtractor project.
This was worked on during April 2023, and has had minor formatting changes made to the report after completion file to fix formatting

The software used for the project was Intel Quartus Prime and Modelsim.
Quartus was used to draw the diagrams for each of the components and combine them through a hierarchy system. Also, it was used for simulating each component.
Modelsim was used to simulate the Bit Serial Adder Subtractor after all the components were combined.
